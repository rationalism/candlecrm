["TATTOO REMOVAL FAQs:" "b"]
["" "b"]
["How does laser tattoo removal work?" "b"]
["The laser light is passed over the tattooed skin, microscopically shattering the pigment into tiny particles which are more easily processed and eliminated by the body.  Most patients undergo a series of 10 minute treatments.  A mild to moderate irritation of the overlying skin is to be expected for a few days to a week, depending on the depth and amount of pigment to be removed." "b"]
["" "b"]
["Who performs the procedures?  Our physicians, physician assistants and registered nurses have been extensively trained on tattoo removal." "b"]
["" "b"]
["Can all colors be removed?  Most colors can be removed completely.  Some colors may require more treatments than others." "b"]
["" "b"]
["How many treatments will I need?  Tattoo removal requires multiple treatments spaced 4-8 weeks apart.  There are several different factors involved in determining how many treatments your particular tattoo will need." "b"]
["" "b"]
["Does it hurt?  There is a minimal amount of discomfort involved in this procedure. Most patients require an anesthetic cream to be applied 30 minutes before the procedure.  As we treat the area, we cool the overlying skin with a skin cooling device.  This combination of topical anesthesia and cooling air makes the procedure as comfortable as possible." "b"]

["I've been marching in the San Francisco Pride Parade for 20 years, and each year our community moves one step closer towards full equality. This year is no exception. While the LGBTQ community has advanced tremendously on issues like marriage equality, healthcare access, and parental rights, we are now confronted by a reactionary backlash from those who would seek to undo that for which we have fought so hard. States like North Carolina and Mississippi are mounting vigorous, last-ditch campaigns to allow LGBTQ discrimination to run rampant under the guise of religious freedom. We cannot afford to let our guard down now." "b"]

And while we have much work left to be done before we can declare “mission accomplished,” let’s take a moment to celebrate what we have achieved together. On June 26, I ask that you join one of the largest pride parades in the world and march in my contingent once again.

We shouldn’t be forcing new mothers and fathers to choose between spending precious bonding time with their children and putting food on the table <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-wiener/fighting-for-full-paid-parental-leave_b_9612534.html>. Under current California law, employees taking parental leave receive 55% of their wages for six weeks through state disability. My legislation, which the Board of Supervisors unanimously passed <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/san-francisco-approves-fully-paid-parental-leave.html>, requires that employers pay their employees the remaining balance of their income, so that for up to six weeks of leave the employee will receive his or her full wages. The legislation applies to both parents and to both births and adoptions.  I’m proud San Francisco is once again taking the lead in putting our workers and our families first, and I hope the state and country follow <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/us/why-parental-leave-policies-are-changing.html?_r=0> and provide more comprehensive parental leave programs. I want to thank my aide, Andres Power <http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/08/paid-parental-leave-san-francisco-new-law-scott-wiener>, who was instrumental in crafting this legislation, and is now out for his own parental leave."

["Better Roofs Ordinance: Requiring Solar Panels on New Construction" "b"]
["" "b"]
["To fight climate change and achieve a clean energy future, we need to take decisive steps to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. That’s why I introduced legislation to require solar panels <http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/02/26/san-francisco-require-solar-panels-new-buildings/> on new residential and commercial buildings constructed in San Francisco, which the Board of Supervisors unanimously passed. The legislation makes San Francisco the first large city in the country to take this important step. Current state law requires that 15% of roof area on new buildings up to ten stories be “solar ready,” which means that portion of the roof is unshaded by the proposed building itself, and free of obstructions. My legislation requires this 15% of roof space have solar actually installed, taking the form of either solar photovoltaic or solar water panels, both of which supply 100% renewable energy. In a dense, urban environment we need to be smart about how we maximize the use of our space to promote the use of renewable energy and improve our environment <http://www.sfexaminer.com/leading-way-solar-energy/>."

["" "b"]
["Trees are critical for our environment, health, and quality of life, yet for nearly 40 years, San Francisco has failed in funding the basic task of maintaining our urban forest. We now have a chance to correct course and create a vibrant and growing tree canopy for all residents. To do this, I introduced a ballot measure that requires the City to assume responsibility for all street trees <http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-Supervisor-Wiener-proposes-parcel-tax-to-pay-7255902.php>  - including tree maintenance, sidewalk damage, and liability - and provides a long-term dedicated funding source to allow the city to do so.  The funding source is a combination of funding from the current city budget - representing what the city has, on average, spent on street trees over the past decade - and a progressive parcel tax of about $29.50 for condo owners, $35 for owners of most single family homes and small apartment buildings, and more for larger commercial buildings.  Property owners should not have to repair broken sidewalks caused by street trees or be liable for any damage caused by these trees. This policy needs to be fixed in a sustainable way." "b"]

The Board unanimously passed this legislation <http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-supervisors-tackle-alleged-police-misconduct-7244974.php> a few weeks ago.

We are making unprecedented infrastructure investments in San Francisco, and taxpayers deserve the best overall value when we spend precious public dollars to pave our streets, renovate our parks, and build our transit systems. Under the current bid award system, only the bid price is considered, with the lowest bidder automatically receiving the contract award. No other factor, including past performance, safety record, or relevant experience is included when awarding bids. This leaves us vulnerable to getting lower quality bids that can result in problematic projects and ultimately higher costs for the public <http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/S-F-tries-to-fire-contractor-over-gas-leaks-in-6589761.php>.  My legislation will change that process so that City departments, in addition to considering bid price, can also consider the contractor’s past track record <http://sfappeal.com/2016/03/legislation-would-make-it-harder-for-bad-contractors-to-win-city-contracts/>."

["intuit(R) Service for Intuit PaymentNetwork ends May 31, 2016   Urgent Service Notice Dear Bryan Young,  This is a reminder that we've recently updated our invoice payment options and will soon discontinue Intuit PaymentNetwork (IPN). To make sure you still have a way to accept payments, we'd like to let you now about our new eInvoicing service. What is changing? Your ability to send invoices containing an IPN payment link and send payments with the Pay Vendor tool will be shut off May 31, 2016. Your customers will still be able to pay invoices through your Pay Link until June 30, 2016. You can also download any IPN payments you receive and review past transactions until June 30, 2016. With this change, we'd like to introduce a new eInvoicing option for you to bill your customers. Customers can still pay you online and will enjoy an updated payment experience. Unfortunately, we are unable to convert your existing IPN account to use with eInvoicing and you will have to sign up for a new Payments account. However, don't worry, you will retain the same rate and fee plan as you had with IPN. If you use the IPN website (ipn.intuit.com) or QuickBooks for Mac We recommend you switch to QuickBooks Online and start using eInvoicing as soon as possible to avoid disruption to your business. Why switch? QuickBooks Mac does not offer eInvoicing and the IPN website is going away. Click here to choose a plan. If you currently use QuickBooks Online with a payments account, you can begin using eInvoicing imediately. No need to sign-up for a new payments account. Simply skip to step #3 below.  Sign into QuickBooks Online, then follow these steps: For IPN Website Users   1. Select the option to create a new company file and follow the prompts. 2. Sign-up for a new Payments account using this link to retain current rate plan (learn more) 3. Learn how to create an invoice with pay now button and set up recurring payments For QuickBooks for Mac Users   1. Transfer your QuickBooks company data 2. Sign-up for a new Payments account using this link to retain current rate plan (learn more) 3. Learn how to create an invoice with a pay now button and set up recurring payments If you use QuickBooks for Windows We recommend you upgrade to QuickBooks 2016 and start using eInvoicing as soon as possible to avoid disruption to your business. Click here to purchase QuickBooks 2016. After installing QuickBooks, you'll need to follow these steps. For QuickBooks for Windows Users 1. Transfer your QuickBooks data 2. Sign-up for a new Payments account using this link 3. Learn how to create an invoice with a pay now button and set up recurring payments Please switch to QuickBooks by May 31, 2016 to avoid service disruption. What if I have questions? We've answered many questions in our online support center. Thank you,       This message was sent to inform you of a critical matter.

["" "b"]
["I dislike relying on peer review as an unbreakable backstop.  Yes, it's an important step in vetting material, but it isn't the end-all.  As you know, the fact that a belief made it through peer review doesn't make it true.  It also doesn't reflect a general scientific consensus, which is the actual thing you should most often trust.  I can confirm su3su2u1's statement about actual lab-coat wearing materials scientists and what they think of Drexler's nanomachine stuff.  His and my viewpoint on this is not unanimous, but widely held.  So why doesn't it appear in the peer reviewed literature?  From my perspective: why the hell would anyone go to the trouble?  Most materials scientists are too busy doing actual science to spend time publishing untestable opinions about the future of nanotech.  Smalley took the time to do this (and he was an uncharacteristically philosophical materials scientist) in the C&amp;EN column.  Beyond that there isn't much reason to do so.  It won't advance your career.  It's not worth arguing over such unlikely hypotheticals.  So you don't find these refutations in the literature.

["Why We Are Taking a Neutral Position on Prop C" "b"]
["There's one housing initiative on the June 7th ballot that the SFHAC's Ballot Analysis Committee weighed in on. After extensive discussion, SFHAC decided to take a neutral position on Prop C, which would raise the Inclusionary requirements for market-rate development. While our members support the measure's intent, it's hard to know if it will maximize the production of affordable housing. Frankly, it could result in less. Our blog explains  (http://sfhac.us4.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=c3361c8f451b03fe35d428986&id=8fea65e528&e=1f00e461b5) this (http://sfhac.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c3361c8f451b03fe35d428986&id=800a419339&e=1f00e461b5) , weighing the initiative's pros and cons."

The longer the ballots are in the hands of city officials before the results are publicly released, the more opportunity there is for malfeasance.
